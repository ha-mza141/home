      <p>Running a small business comes with its share of expenses—but many entrepreneurs miss out on key tax deductions that could significantly reduce their taxable income. Whether you're a sole proprietor, LLC, or small corporation, knowing which expenses are deductible can save you thousands of dollars at tax time.

In this article, we’ll explore the top 15 tax deductions for small businesses and how to claim them effectively.</p>
      
      <h2>📌 1. Home Office Deduction</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>If you work from a dedicated space at home, you may be able to deduct a portion of your rent, utilities, and internet. Make sure the space is used exclusively for business to qualify.

</li>
    
      </ul>
      
      <h2>📌 2. Business Use of Vehicle
</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You can deduct either actual vehicle expenses (gas, maintenance, depreciation) or use the standard mileage rate (65.5 cents per mile for 2023). Keep detailed mileage logs!

</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <h2>📌 3. Office Supplies
</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Everything from paper and pens to software subscriptions and postage counts. Keep receipts and organize purchases by category for easy reporting.

</li>
       
      </ul>
      
      <h2>📌 4. Equipment & Furniture
</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Laptops, monitors, printers, desks—these qualify as capital expenses. You can deduct them over time (depreciation) or use Section 179 to deduct the full cost in the purchase year.

</li>
     
      </ul>
      <h2>📌 5. Business Meals

</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">

</li>
     
      </ul>

      <h2>📌 8. Phone and Internet Bills


</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
